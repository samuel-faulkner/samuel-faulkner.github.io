## What did I like least about the class?
I felt like I wasn't evaluated fairly by the projects in this class. This isn't a fault of CS373: Software Engineering but more a fault of group projects in general. It's also impossible to change group members once you complete the first phase of the IDB project, so you're stuck with the same group the entire semester. My team lost many points from areas of the project that I had no control over on several phases.

## What did I like most about the class?
The Hackrrank tests are great. They're easy and didn't cause me any stress at all. The greatest thing about them is the ability to test your code before you submit it. This makes it really easy to do well on the tests, because there should be no surprises in your grade. The addition of a cheatsheet makes studying almost irrelevant other than writing down all of the necessary items on the sheet.

## What's the most significant thing I learned?
Python's decorators were something that had always puzzled me until Downing went over in class. His explanation was the most clear of any article I had read on the internet before about the subject.

## How many hours a week did you spend coding for this class?
I probably spent 15-20 hours a week coding for this class. Our [website](http://gameframe.online) required a lot of frontend coding and logic for the amount of data we utilized (over 170,000 articles!)

## How many hours a week did you spend reading for this class?
I read through the first assigned book, "Extreme Programming Installed", which I enjoyed but it's outdated. This probably took me about an hour a week of reading. But after that, I didn't keep up with the reading for the class and hardly spent any time reading at all.

## How many lines of code do I think I wrote?
A few thousand. Over the course of 3 months this isn't too much.

## What required tool did I not know that I now find very useful?
My team for the IDB projects didn't use [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) because I already knew how to setup the boilerplate with [babel](https://babeljs.io/), [webpack](https://webpack.js.org/), and [bootstrap](https://react-bootstrap.github.io/). In hindsight, we should've just used create-react-app. I've since found out that create-react-app includes hot-reloading and many other convenient additions to developer experience that we missed out on while working on our frontend.

## What's the most useful Web dev tool that your group used that was not required?
[React-Redux](https://redux.js.org/) was essential for the scope of our project. There were so many moving pieces and caching that we implemented that it would be crazy if we attempted to keep track of all of this state inside React components themselves. Redux makes this simple with just a little extra coding.

## If I could change one thing about the course, what would it be?
There are a few things I would change, but if I can only pick one, I would allow teams to use [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/) for a backend for the IDB projects. NodeJS has multitudes of documentation, tutorials, and blogs on ORM's, servers, database drivers, and all of the other things that are required for this project that [Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/) just doesn't have as much info on. Flask hit version 1.0 only about a week ago! And companies value experience in NodeJS just as much as Flask, if not more, so there certainly wouldn't be a loss in using NodeJS rather than Flask. Finally, NodeJS has many frameworks that bootstrap application development like [Express](https://expressjs.com/), [Sails](https://sailsjs.com/), [Hapi](https://hapijs.com/), [Koa](https://koajs.com/), and many more.
