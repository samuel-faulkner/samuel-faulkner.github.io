## What did I do this past week?
This past week was a busy week of homework and projects. I've been busy working on project 1 in Software Engineering as well as a Caesar Cipher for Intro to Security. Plus, I've had homework in Number Theory that I've been typing up using [LaTeX](https://www.latex-project.org/) which is a curse and a blessing-- I have to look up characters and symbols but I can also abuse the copy-paste feature of typing my homework rather than writing it by hand.

## What's in my way?
I caught the flu this weekend, which hasn't been too much of a hindrance except for yesterday. I was bedridden nearly the entire day and wasn't able to accomplish everything I wanted to. But thankfully I did catch the virus early and am already on medication, which will allow me to return to school Monday without missing any class.

## What will I do next week?
Next week my first priority will be to finish project 1. I've been putting it off completing it in favor of more pressing deadlines and assignments but now it's time to finish it. I'll make sure to do a better job of keeping up with the reading assignments in Software Engineering as being behind certainly won't help me with the daily quizzes.

## What's my experience with the class?
I like the class so far. I really haven't learned much compared to classes like operating systems or networks but I'm getting a sense of industry practices that I may have overlooked or not utilized during my internships. Code coverage is something I've never used before and have never seen outside of an open source project. But the usefulness is fascinating and I'm glad we'll get to use it during the course.

## What's my tip-of-the-week?
If you've contracted a virus recently, go to University Health Services and check to see if you have the flu. I woke up Saturday morning thinking I had nothing more than a cold but my mom insisted I go to the clinic to diagnose myself and that's the only way I was able to catch it early enough to get prescribed medicine and be relatively okay. I've been to UHS several times and the biggest hassle is just walking over the to Student Services Building. If you have good insurance its cheap and you'll save a lot of time and pain. It's easy, the people there are friendly, just schedule an appointment.
