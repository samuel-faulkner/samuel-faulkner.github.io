## What did I do this past week?
This past week I spent a lot of my time working on the IDB project. After a few initial meetups with my team in order to pick our idea, we've spent several more meetings setting up and delegating tasks. It was a good thing I've used React and related tools before, as we decided to jump right into React and as a Windows Home edition user I have no way of setting up my environment using Docker. But my team has been able to start getting into the coding side of the website and we've made great progress.

## What's in my way?
Looking back at my previous posts I'm beginning to sound like a broken record. My biggest obstacles are still my other classes. I thought I was good at time management by now but I'm currently very stressed about not forgetting anything and getting everything done on time. This semester is particularly peculiar as my courses aren't particularly hard but they all seem to assign a large amount of homework.

## What will I do next week?
Next week I will still be keeping up with school as well as finishing phase 1 for our project. I'm glad I've got a really good, collaborative team that I can depend on to get all responsibilities done in time-- this will really help me fall asleep at night.

## What's my experience with the class?
I'm still pretty bored in lecture as I mentioned [last week](https://samuel-faulkner.github.io/Finshing-in-February) although I'm really happy with our idea for my team's IDB project. This has renewed my energy in this class and I look forward to working on it and with my teammates to create something really cool, not just for the grade for our class. My only wish was that I had more time I could spend working on it every week.

## What's my tip-of-the-week?
My tip of the week is one word: 'lists'. I've started listing out everything I need to do in a day so that I don't forget anything. It really helps keep my mind at ease when I know I can go back to my list for the day to double check that everything that needs to be done is done, there's no lingering thought that I'm forgetting something.
