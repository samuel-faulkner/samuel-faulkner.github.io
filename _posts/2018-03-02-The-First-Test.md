## What did I do this past week?
This past week I didn't do much other than study and take the first exam. I think it went pretty well, the questions definitely weren't too difficult and Downing had given us all the information needed to do well in class. I also had another exam in CS361 this week, and I have two exams in math next week. So there was lots of studying and not much work on the IDB project.

## What's in my way?
As I've mentioned, I have two exams next week which I anticipate to be very hard and require a lot of studying. Also, they're on the same day. I also have a presentation due the day before both exams. So next week will be challenging, but the days before spring break will hopefully be stress-free as I will have completed my exams by then.

## What will I do next week?
Next, I anticipate more studying for my other exams and then getting back on track with the IDB project. My entire group has taken a break for the exam so I expect us to start back up again and hopefully make a lot of progress before we leave for Spring Break.

## What's my experience with the class?
I'm continuing to enjoy the lectures and the material taught. I'm excited about what's coming next after the test because the content can only get more interesting from here. I might not have found all the material that interesting from the start of class until now, but at least Downing doesn't spend any more time than he has to on it. I enjoy the pacing of the class and hope to learn more in the coming weeks.

## What's my pick-of-the-week?
My pick of the week has to be [this](https://hackernoon.com/reduce-webpack-bundle-size-for-production-880bb6b2c72f) article. This article goes into depth about how to reduce the size of our naively packed javascript code we're serving on our website currently. Also, I appreciate how this article has no bloated words or advertisements-- just explaining step by step solutions to the problem. Which is a rather big problem as our [website](http://gameframe.online) is currently trying to serve a 5.5 Mb javascript bundle over the internet. I'm not sure anyone other than our graders has that much patience to load a simple site!
