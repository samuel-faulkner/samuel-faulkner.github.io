## What did I do this past week?
This past week I the only thing productive thing I really did was take two math exams. Other than that all I did was work on IDB project and play video games until I went home for spring break on Thursday. Kasra and Quang gave a presentation about React and Flask on Monday, and it gave my group some much-needed pointers on decoupling the frontend and backend on our project. Elaine Rich and Alan Cline came and gave a lecture on Wednesday which was interesting to listen to. Alan Cline is especially funny and engaging.

## What's in my way?
Nothing's really in my way over the break. I'm not physically meeting with my team for the IDB project at all this week so perhaps communication may become an issue, but we've been pretty good at utilizing [Slack](https://slack.com/) to keep up with each other. I think we'll be able to get a lot done over the break as we don't have as many distractions when we're on campus.

## What will I do next week?
Next week I have a couple homework assignments to work on as well as the IDB project. I know there are tons and tons of research for pair programming, but I find myself able to pump out code more quickly when I'm alone and not under pressure. So hopefully I'll be able to get a lot done for phase 2 of the IDB project.

## What's my experience with the class?
This week didn't give me much insight into the class, as the two days I attended we didn't have normal lectures. I did like both of the lectures though. I'm also still liking the class as a whole so far. I'm interested in seeing where the class goes after spring break and our first test.

## What's my pick of the week?
We won't be able to use this for IDB, but [Preact](https://preactjs.com/) is a lightweight, fast alternative to React. It uses the same API but sacrifices a little of the browser compatibility for a very, very small footprint (3kb) in comparison to React (31.8k). In any application that doesn't require the complete, robust and fully compatible framework of React, Preact would be the way to go. [Jupyter](http://jupyter.org/) is one application I know of that uses Preact.
