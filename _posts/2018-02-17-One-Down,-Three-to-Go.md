## What did I do this week?
This week my team finished up phase 1 of the IDB project. I also completed the peer review, as well as started on the readings for databases. I also had a few sleepless nights doing homework for my other classes, and I still wasn't able to complete it all. I'm very glad that most of my classes allow dropped homework.

## What's in my way?
I think next week will be less busy than most, so hopefully, there won't be much in my way. I still have a week before I start getting hit with exams, so I'm really looking forward to a week that I can dedicate more time to phase 2 of the IDB project.

## What will I do next week?
Next week I plan on attending a few team meetings for my IDB team to discuss how we want to go about phase 2. Although we've already implemented [React](https://reactjs.org/) in our frontend code, we did it in a very crude and static way. There are tons of hardcoded links and file paths all throughout our source code. So we'll need to make a plan and go over the necessary extra tools and dependencies we'll have to introduce into the project in order to straighten out our frontend code, not to mention get up and running with a javascript test runner.

## What's my experience with the class?
My experience hasn't really changed much up to this point, I still feel like I haven't really learned anything I couldn't find out by searching [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/). I guess most of the material relevant to software engineering is to be learned through the readings and working throughout the projects. I'm getting a better sense of why Downing has mandatory quizzes in this course because although he's very enjoyable to listen to during lecture, I probably wouldn't attend without the quizzes.

## What's my pick-of-the-week?
[/r/reactjs](https://www.reddit.com/r/reactjs/) is an alright resource for React and React related technologies, but my favorite find from that subreddit is [this](https://github.com/enaqx/awesome-react) list. It shows an enormous list of helper libraries, tools, and more React related software that can supplement React to create awesome things without reinventing the wheel.
