## What did I do this past week?
This past week I spent a lot of time working on Phase 2 of the IDB project. Phase 2 is a lot of work and required a lot of boilerplate code and configuration that needed to be set up for the frontend and I'm the only member of my team that has set up a boilerplate like this before. Our repo has several more tools to facilitate the extra requirements for Phase 2: [mocha](mochajs.org), [enzyme](https://github.com/airbnb/enzyme), [sinon](sinonjs.org), among others. I also worked on getting our [About Page](gameframe.online/about) almost completely dynamic-- no more hardcoded contributors, bios, or any of it. All pulled from Github or from our own web server when a user visits the page.

## What's in my way?
The next two weeks for me are going to be pretty tough. I have 4 exams from next Thursday, March 1st to Tuesday, March 6th with a presentation in between there. Thankfully my classes' homework load has lightened but I don't think I'll be able to contribute much to the project for awhile.

## What will I do next week?
Next week will be filled with studying for my exams. I don't plan on working on Phase 2 of the IDB project much at all unless I forgot to commit something (which happens **way** to often) and/or my teammate needs help with the new boilerplate.

## What's my experience with the class?
This week has been my favorite week of the class so far. We've finally ventured into material that I don't feel like is easily learned outside of the classroom. I haven't been bored this week. It took over a month to get to this point but I really like going to class now. I'm also very interested in the database readings as I feel like their more applicable and relevant... the *Extreme Programming Installed* book seems very out of date. When discussing versioning software it didn't even mention [git](https://git-scm.com/).

## What's my pick-of-the-week?
My pick of the week would have to be [redux-actions](https://github.com/reduxactions/redux-actions). This helper library makes reduces tons of work when writing [Redux](https://redux.js.org/) code. It was a little confusing to use at first, but [this](https://codeburst.io/redux-actions-through-example-part-1-f5b2dc71de06) article series removed a lot of the confusion for me. Hopefully, the usage of Redux and libraries like these make our IDB project reliable as well as its code readable.
