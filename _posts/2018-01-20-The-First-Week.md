## What are my expectations of the class?
I know several people who have gone through this class before, so I've gathered many expectations from listening to their stories. I expect the in-class quizzes to be one of the hardest parts of the course despite the presence of major projects. I expect the lectures to be entertaining although they won't pertain to the projects as Prof Downing explained on the first class day. As for the projects themselves, I expect that they'll touch on full stack web development-- which I hope is the case as I've got a lot of professional experience writing servers and small websites.

## What did I do this past week?
This past week I enjoyed a relaxing two extra days before starting school due to MLK Jr. Day and the weather.

## What's in my way?
This course seems like a lot of fun and a welcome break from the tough courses I took last semester, but the quizzes in this class might sour the entire experience.

## What will I do next week?
Next week will be a more thorough week of classes. I'm guessing that homework and projects will begin to pick up, so likely my time will be more focused on that and away from my free time. As I mentioned above, I'll have done some studying for these quizzes in order to gauge how difficult they'll be and how much effort is required in order to receive a good grade for my efforts

## What's my experience with the class?
I don't have much to say here as I've only had two class days. I did enjoy both class days, especially the last one (Friday, 1/19) as Downing explained Docker in a very detailed way and its a piece of software I've always heard of and wondered about but never had any time to explore it for myself. 

## What's my pick-of-the-week?
I've just recently used Amazon Web Services in a personal project, specifically S3. I was expecting a long, boring afternoon of documentation reading, coding, and debugging, but it wasn't that bad. The system works well and best of all-- free
